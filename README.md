# Smart Appliances SRS Project

Welcome to the Smart Appliances SRS Project! This repository contains the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document and a static prototype for an innovative platform that aims to revolutionize the way users interact with smart appliances. I have also added the other details such as working that we did to make the SRS document, and the other supproting files.

## Project Overview

Smart Appliances is a platform designed to automate and control smart appliances remotely via a smartphone. Targeting both homes and businesses, users can log in to their accounts, pay a monthly fee of Rs 300, and access their smart appliances through the platform. The system allows users to create rooms and devices within those rooms, schedule appliance usage, and operate appliances remotely.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Home and business users can log in to their accounts and pay the monthly subscription fee.
  
- **Payment Integration**: Banks are integrated into the application for seamless payment processing. Users receive email receipts upon payment.
  
- **Room and Device Management**: Users can create rooms and add devices, restricting usage to specific areas unless moved.
  
- **Appliance Scheduling**: Users can schedule appliance usage at specific times.
  
- **Remote Access**: Users can control appliances remotely from outside their homes or businesses.
  
- **Manufacturer Registration**: Companies manufacturing smart appliances can register their products on the platform for a fee of Rs 1000. Details of registered appliances are visible to users.
  
- **Admin Management**: System Admin manages the application and coordinates with manufacturers.

## SRS Document

The SRS document in this repository outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, use cases, and system architecture necessary to develop the Smart Appliances platform. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders.

## Prototype

A static prototype created using Figma provides a visual representation of the Smart Appliances platform. It demonstrates the user interface and interactions, offering insight into the project's potential look and feel.
