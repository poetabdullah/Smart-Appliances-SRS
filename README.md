> A **Software Requirement Specification (SRS) & prototype** for a next-gen platform that **redefines how users interact with smart appliances** — combining **remote access, automation, subscription-based access, and manufacturer integration**.

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Smart Appliances platform** is designed to bring **automation, scheduling, and remote control** to modern households and businesses.
With a simple **Rs 300 monthly subscription**, users can securely log in, add appliances, manage rooms, and control everything from their smartphone.

🔑 **Highlights:**

* 🏠 Designed for both **homes & businesses**
* 💳 Built-in **payment & subscription system**
* 📱 **Remote control** from anywhere
* 🏭 Manufacturers can **register appliances** for visibility & integration
* 👨‍💻 **Admin management** for streamlined operations

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔐 **User Authentication** – Login with secure credentials, tied to subscription.
* 💳 **Payment Integration** – Pay monthly fees with **bank integration**; instant email receipts.
* 🛋️ **Room & Device Management** – Create rooms, assign devices, move or restrict usage.
* ⏰ **Appliance Scheduling** – Automate device usage at specific times.
* 🌍 **Remote Access** – Control appliances from anywhere via smartphone.
* 🏭 **Manufacturer Registration** – Companies can list appliances (Rs 1000 fee) for users to discover.
* 🛠️ **Admin Dashboard** – Full system management + manufacturer coordination.

## 📑 Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

The included **SRS document** serves as a complete blueprint for developers and stakeholders:

* 📌 **Functional Requirements**
* 📌 **Non-Functional Requirements**
* 📌 **Use Cases & User Stories**
* 📌 **System Architecture**
* 📌 **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**
* 📌 **Workflow Models (DFDs, UML)**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The Smart Appliances platform follows a **multi-layered design**:

1. **Presentation Layer** – Mobile/desktop UI for users & admins
2. **Application Layer** – Core logic for authentication, scheduling, payments, and device control
3. **Database Layer** – Stores users, rooms, appliances, transactions, and manufacturer data
4. **Integration Layer** – Bank APIs, manufacturer onboarding

---

## 🚀 How It Works (User Flow)

1. **Sign Up / Log In**
   → Users create accounts & pay **Rs 300 monthly subscription**.
2. **Room & Device Setup**
   → Add rooms, register appliances, manage device groups.
3. **Control & Scheduling**
   → Turn appliances on/off, set timers, and automate usage.
4. **Remote Access**
   → Control appliances **from anywhere via smartphone**.
5. **Manufacturer & Admin Access**
   → Appliance manufacturers register products; admin oversees everything.
